# FIUBA: Machine Learning Notebooks 🎓

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of implementations and projects developed during the **Machine Learning** coursework at the **University of Buenos Aires (FIUBA)**. 

The focus is on understanding the mathematical foundations and practical applications of various algorithms using **Python** and libraries such as `Scikit-Learn`, `PyMC`, and `Pandas`.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The notebooks are organized by model type and learning paradigm:

### 🔹 Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
- **Linear & Polynomial Regression:** Foundational models for continuous variable prediction.
- **Logistic Regression:** Binary classification and decision boundaries.
- **Decision Trees & SVM:** Non-linear classification and Support Vector Machine implementations.
- **Naive Bayes (Multinomial):** Probabilistic classifiers for discrete data.
- **LDA, QDA & KNN:** Comparison between Discriminant Analysis and instance-based learning.

### 🔹 Probabilistic & Bayesian Modeling
- **Gaussian Variational Bayes:** Approximate inference for complex distributions.
- **PyMC Implementation:** Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Programming.

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Feature extraction and data visualization.
- **Clustering & Unsupervised Learning:** Pattern discovery in unlabeled datasets.

### 🔹 Special Applications
- **Recommender Systems:** Implementation of Latent Models (LM) for recommendation engines.
