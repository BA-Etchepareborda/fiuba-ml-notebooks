# Machine Learning & Data Science Portfolio (FIUBA)

This repository contains a curated collection of projects and notebooks developed during my studies at the **University of Buenos Aires (FIUBA)**, focusing on Machine Learning and statistical analysis.

## 📊 Key Highlights
- **Datathon FIUBA Winner (2023):** Predictive modeling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) under time constraints.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of regression and classification models using `Scikit-Learn`.
- **Deep Learning Foundations:** Neural network experiments using `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Frameworks:** Scikit-Learn, PyTorch.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📈 Key Findings
- Optimization of hyperparameters in ensemble models (XGBoost/RandomForest) to improve F1-Score in imbalanced datasets.
- Feature engineering techniques for high-dimensional engineering data.
